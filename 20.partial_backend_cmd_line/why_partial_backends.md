## PARTIAL BACKEND

---

## üåç What Is a Backend?

The **backend** in Terraform defines **where and how the state file is stored** ‚Äî for example:

* Locally (`local`)
* Remotely (e.g. in AWS S3, Terraform Cloud, Azure Blob, GCS, etc.)

Example:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-state-demo"
    key    = "global/s3/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

## üß© What Is Partial Backend Configuration?

A **partial backend configuration** means:

* You **only define part of the backend settings** in the Terraform configuration file (`terraform { backend "..." { ... } }`)
* The **remaining settings** (like credentials or sensitive data) are provided **later**, usually via CLI flags, environment variables, or `terraform init` input prompts.

In short:

> Terraform lets you ‚Äúpartially define‚Äù the backend in code and ‚Äúcomplete it‚Äù at initialization.

---

## üß± Why Terraform Allows This

This design allows:

* **Security:** Keep sensitive values (like access keys) **out of version control**.
* **Flexibility:** Use the same Terraform configuration in multiple environments (e.g., dev/staging/prod) with different backend buckets or keys.
* **Team collaboration:** Developers can provide their own backend details during setup.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example 1 ‚Äî Partial S3 Backend



## üìÅ Folder Structure

```
terraform-partial-backend-demo/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.tf
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backend.hcl
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ variables.tf
```

---

### `main.tf` (partial)

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

### CLI initialization

```bash
terraform init \
  -backend-config="bucket=my-terraform-backend" \
  -backend-config="key=env/dev/terraform.tfstate"
```

Here:

* The `region` is defined in the code.
* The `bucket` and `key` are provided **at runtime**.

‚úÖ Terraform merges both to form a complete backend configuration.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example 2 ‚Äî Separate config file

You can also keep backend info in a separate file like `backend.hcl`:

```hcl
bucket = "terraform-backend-demo"
key    = "prod/state.tfstate"
region = "us-east-1"
```

Then initialize Terraform with:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
```

## üîê Benefits

| Benefit            | Description                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Security**       | Keep secrets and credentials out of Git repos.           |
| **Reusability**    | Reuse the same Terraform code in different environments. |
| **Team Safety**    | Prevent accidental overwriting of state files.           |
| **CI/CD Friendly** | Pass backend details dynamically in pipelines.           |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* **All required backend arguments** must be supplied *either* in code *or* at init time ‚Äî otherwise, `terraform init` will fail.
* Once initialized, the backend configuration is **stored in `.terraform/`**.
* To change backend settings later, run:

  ```bash
  terraform init -migrate-state
  ```

---

### üß† Summary

> **Partial backend configuration** = defining only some backend settings in your `.tf` files, and completing the rest interactively or through CLI/environment variables.

It‚Äôs a best practice for:

* Sensitive backend credentials
* Multi-environment Terraform setups
* Shared team workflows

## MORE ABOUT PARTIAL BACKEND

Perfect üëè ‚Äî let‚Äôs walk through a **realistic demo** that uses **partial backend configuration** with **S3 + DynamoDB locking**, the right way.

---

## üß© Goal

You‚Äôll create a Terraform project that:

* Stores its **state file in an S3 bucket**.
* Uses **DynamoDB** for state locking.
* Keeps the backend configuration **partial** ‚Äî meaning only *non-sensitive* settings are in code, and the rest are passed dynamically.

---

## üß™ Example for Multi-Environment Use

You can have multiple backend config files:

```
backend-dev.hcl
backend-prod.hcl
```

**backend-dev.hcl**

```hcl
bucket         = "terraform-backend-demo-gamor"
key            = "state/dev/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "us-east-1"
dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks-dev"
```

**backend-prod.hcl**

```hcl
bucket         = "terraform-backend-demo-gamor"
key            = "state/prod/terraform.tfstate"
region         = "us-east-1"
dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks-prod"
```

Then initialize depending on environment:

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=backend-dev.hcl
# or
terraform init -backend-config=backend-prod.hcl
```

Terraform will then automatically store the state in the right S3 location for each environment.

## ‚úÖ Summary

| Component                              | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Partial config in main.tf**          | Keeps region and backend type (safe values).                     |
| **backend.hcl file**                   | Holds bucket name, state key, DynamoDB table (sensitive values). |
| **terraform init -backend-config=...** | Merges both configurations at runtime.                           |
| **Advantage**                          | Secure, flexible, environment-friendly setup.                    |
