# 🧩 Terraform Backend & Provider Configuration

## 📘 Overview

This configuration defines:

1. The **AWS provider** that Terraform will use to deploy and manage AWS resources.
2. An **S3 backend** where Terraform will **store the state file remotely** instead of locally.

Storing the Terraform state in an S3 bucket ensures:

* Shared access across team members
* Centralized and secure state management
* Persistent history of infrastructure changes

---

## ⚙️ Full Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 5.0"
    }
  }

  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "terraform-s3-backend-authentication-demo-gamor"
    key    = "terraform/state/terraform.tfstate"   # S3 storage path
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```

---

## 🧠 Explanation

### **1️⃣ required_providers Block**

```hcl
required_providers {
  aws = {
    source  = "hashicorp/aws"
    version = "~> 5.0"
  }
}
```

This tells Terraform:

* To use the **AWS provider** maintained by **HashiCorp**.
* To use **any AWS provider version ≥ 5.0.0 and < 6.0.0**, ensuring compatibility and stability.

✅ Terraform will automatically download the provider plugin when you run `terraform init`.

---

### **2️⃣ backend "s3" Block**

```hcl
backend "s3" {
  bucket = "terraform-s3-backend-authentication-demo-gamor"
  key    = "terraform/state/terraform.tfstate"
  region = "us-east-1"
}
```

This configures **where Terraform will store its state**.

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **bucket** | The name of the S3 bucket where the Terraform state will be stored.                         |
| **key**    | The path (key) inside the S3 bucket for the state file. Think of it as a folder path in S3. |
| **region** | The AWS region where the S3 bucket is hosted.                                               |

📘 **Example:**
In this configuration, the state file will be stored at:
`s3://terraform-s3-backend-authentication-demo-gamor/terraform/state/terraform.tfstate`

---

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Usage

### **1️⃣ Initialize Terraform**

Run the following command to initialize the backend and download the required providers:

```bash
terraform init
```

✅ **Expected Output:**

```
Initializing the backend...

Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.
```

---

### **2️⃣ Validate Configuration**

Check for syntax and internal consistency:

```bash
terraform validate
```

---

### **3️⃣ Apply Your Configuration**

Run:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

Terraform will:

* Deploy resources using the AWS provider.
* Save the resulting state file to your S3 bucket at the path specified in `key`.

---

### **4️⃣ Verify the Remote State**

* Go to the AWS Console → S3 → `terraform-s3-backend-authentication-demo-gamor`
* Navigate to the folder path `terraform/state/`
* You should see the file `terraform.tfstate`

This confirms Terraform is successfully storing its state remotely in S3.

---

## 🛡️ Best Practices

✅ **Enable Bucket Versioning**

```hcl
resource "aws_s3_bucket_versioning" "example" {
  bucket = "terraform-s3-backend-authentication-demo-gamor"

  versioning_configuration {
    status = "Enabled"
  }
}
```

This keeps a historical record of all state file versions.

---

✅ **Use DynamoDB for State Locking**
Add the following to your backend configuration (once you have created a DynamoDB table):

```hcl
backend "s3" {
  bucket         = "terraform-s3-backend-authentication-demo-gamor"
  key            = "terraform/state/terraform.tfstate"
  region         = "us-east-1"
  dynamodb_table = "terraform-locks"
  encrypt        = true
}
```

This prevents multiple users from running `terraform apply` at the same time.

---

✅ **Use Encryption at Rest**
Ensure your S3 bucket has **encryption enabled** to secure state data.

| Component            | Purpose                                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `required_providers` | Declares dependency on AWS provider                                    |
| `backend "s3"`       | Defines remote backend for Terraform state                             |
| `bucket`             | S3 bucket name for storing state                                       |
| `key`                | File path inside S3 where state is saved                               |
| `region`             | AWS region of the bucket                                               |
| **Result**           | Terraform saves state remotely, enabling collaboration and persistence |
