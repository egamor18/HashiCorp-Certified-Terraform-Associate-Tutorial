# 🧪 Terraform Backend Switching Demo

### (Local ↔ S3 ↔ HCP Cloud)

---

## 🧩 Starting Configuration

We are working with `terraform.tf` file:

---

## 🪜 DEMO STEPS

### **Step 1: Use the Local Backend**

* Comment out both the `cloud` and `s3` backend blocks.
* This makes Terraform default to the **local backend**.

Run:

```bash
terraform init
```

✅ Terraform initializes using the **local state file** stored in your working directory (`terraform.tfstate`).

---

### **Step 2: Switch to the S3 Backend**

* Uncomment the **S3 backend** block.
* Keep the **cloud block** commented out.

Run:

```bash
terraform init -migrate-state
```

✅ Terraform will detect that the backend has changed and ask if you want to **migrate your local state** to the new **S3 backend**.
Type `yes` to confirm.

You’ll see output showing the migration of state to your **S3 bucket** and **DynamoDB lock table**.

Run:

```bash
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

✅ Confirm everything still works correctly under the new backend.

---

### **Step 3: Switch Back to the Local Backend**

* Comment out the **S3 backend** block again.
* Keep the **cloud block** commented out.

Run:

```bash
terraform init -migrate-state
```

✅ Terraform will prompt you to **migrate your state back** from S3 to your **local machine**.
Type `yes` to confirm.

Run:

```bash
terraform plan
```

✅ You should see **no changes**, confirming that the state was successfully migrated.

---

### **Step 4: (Optional) Switch to HCP Terraform (Enhanced Backend)**

* Uncomment the **cloud block**.
* Comment out the **S3 backend** block.
* Run:

  ```bash
  terraform init
  ```

  🔸 Terraform will initialize your workspace with **HCP Terraform**.
  🔸 You’ll be prompted to **migrate your state** to HCP.

Type `yes` to confirm.

⚠️ **Important:**
Once migrated to **HCP Terraform (enhanced backend)**, you **cannot** switch back to standard backends (local or S3) using `-migrate-state`.
Terraform will return this error:

```
Error: The -migrate-state option is for migration between state backends only,
and is not applicable when using HCP Terraform.
```

---

### **Step 5: Clean Up**

When done, destroy the demo resources:

```bash
terraform destroy
```

If using **HCP Terraform**, destroy the workspace from the HCP UI afterward.

## 🧠 Summary

| Backend Type  | Description                                                     | Supports `-migrate-state`                |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Local**     | Default backend; state stored locally in `terraform.tfstate`.   | ✅                                        |
| **S3**        | Standard backend; state stored in S3, lock managed in DynamoDB. | ✅                                        |
| **HCP Cloud** | Enhanced backend; remote execution and secure state storage.    | ❌ (migration via interactive steps only) |

---


## ⚠️ Important Note: No Downgrade from Enhanced Backend

Once your workspace is using an **enhanced backend** (such as **HCP Terraform** or **Terraform Cloud**):

* The **state** is now fully managed **remotely** by HashiCorp’s platform.
* It includes **metadata**, **run history**, and **locking features** that do **not exist** in standard backends.
* Because of this, **Terraform cannot safely export or migrate** that state file back to local or S3.

---

### 🔒 In Simple Terms

> Once you go “Cloud” (HCP), you can’t go “Local” again.

---

### 🚫 What This Means Practically

* You **cannot** use:

  ```bash
  terraform init -migrate-state
  ```

  to move back from HCP → local or S3.

* If you really need to return to a standard backend, you must:

  1. **Manually export** the resources (via `terraform state pull`).
  2. **Manually import** them into a new workspace with a local/S3 backend.
     *(This is tedious and error-prone — not recommended.)*

---

### ✅ Recommended Practice

* Always **decide on your backend strategy early** in your project.
* Use **HCP Terraform** only when you’re ready to commit to a managed, collaborative environment.
* Keep **S3 or local** backends for development or personal testing.
