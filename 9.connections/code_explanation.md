## üß© DEEP DIVE INTO THE CODE

### üí° THE EC2 INSTANCE SECTION:

---

### üß± Resource Type

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "ubuntu_server" {
```

* This declares an **EC2 instance** resource in AWS.
* The local name `ubuntu_server` is what Terraform uses to reference it internally (e.g., `aws_instance.ubuntu_server.id`).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Basic Configuration

```hcl
  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.public_subnets["public_subnet_1"].id
```

* **`ami`** ‚Üí The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) that defines the operating system (Ubuntu in this case).

  * It‚Äôs fetched dynamically from a `data "aws_ami" "ubuntu"` data source elsewhere in your config.
* **`instance_type`** ‚Üí Defines the hardware of the instance (CPU, memory, etc.).

  * `t2.micro` = free-tier eligible small instance.
* **`subnet_id`** ‚Üí Places the instance in a specific **subnet** within your **VPC** network.

---

### üîí Security Groups

```hcl
  security_groups = [
    aws_security_group.vpc_ping.id,
    aws_security_group.ingress_ssh.id,
    aws_security_group.vpc_web.id
  ]
```

* These security groups act like **virtual firewalls** controlling inbound/outbound traffic.
* You‚Äôre attaching three:

  * **vpc_ping** ‚Üí allows ICMP (ping) access
  * **ingress_ssh** ‚Üí allows SSH (port 22) access
  * **vpc_web** ‚Üí allows HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)

---

### üåê Networking & SSH Access

```hcl
  associate_public_ip_address = true
  key_name                    = aws_key_pair.generated.key_name
```

* **`associate_public_ip_address`** ‚Üí ensures the instance gets a public IP so you can reach it from the internet.
* **`key_name`** ‚Üí uses the SSH key pair you generated earlier with Terraform:

  * `tls_private_key.generated` ‚Üí creates the key locally
  * `aws_key_pair.generated` ‚Üí uploads the public key to AWS
  * Together, these allow you to SSH into the instance securely.

---

### üîë Connection Block

```hcl
  connection {
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = tls_private_key.generated.private_key_pem
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
```

* Defines how Terraform connects to the EC2 instance for remote provisioning.
* **`user`**: login username (Ubuntu AMIs use `"ubuntu"`)
* **`private_key`**: the local PEM file you generated earlier (`MyAWSKey.pem`)
* **`host`**: the instance‚Äôs public IP (automatically fetched via `self.public_ip`)

This connection is used by the **`remote-exec` provisioner** below.

---

### üîÅ Lifecycle Rule

```hcl
  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [security_groups]
  }
```

* Tells Terraform **not to recreate the instance** if only the attached security groups change.
* This prevents unnecessary destruction/recreation during minor security group updates.

---

### ‚ö° Provisioners

#### Local Exec

```hcl
  provisioner "local-exec" {
    command = "chmod 600 ${local_file.private_key_pem.filename}"
  }
```

* Runs **on your local machine**, not on AWS.
* Adjusts permissions of your PEM file (`MyAWSKey.pem`) so SSH won‚Äôt reject it.

  * `chmod 600` = owner read/write only (required for private SSH keys).

#### Remote Exec

```hcl
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo rm -rf /tmp",
      "sudo git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/demo-terraform-101 /tmp",
      "sudo sh /tmp/assets/setup-web.sh"
    ]
  }
```

* Runs **inside the EC2 instance**, via SSH.
* It performs three setup steps:

  1. Deletes any old `/tmp` folder.
  2. Clones a public GitHub repo containing setup scripts.
  3. Executes a shell script (`setup-web.sh`) that configures a demo web server.

This makes your EC2 automatically deploy a web app when created.

---

### üè∑Ô∏è Tags

```hcl
  tags = {
    Name = "Ubuntu EC2 Server"
  }
```

* Adds metadata labels in AWS for identification and cost tracking.
* Appears in the AWS console as the instance‚Äôs name.

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Concept                   | Purpose                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `ami`, `instance_type`    | Define OS and hardware         |
| `security_groups`         | Control traffic                |
| `key_name` & `connection` | Enable SSH access              |
| `lifecycle`               | Avoid unnecessary recreation   |
| `local-exec`              | Fix key permissions locally    |
| `remote-exec`             | Configure server automatically |
| `tags`                    | Name the instance              |

---


### üß© Connection Block ‚Äî What It *Actually* Does

The **`connection` block** in Terraform **doesn‚Äôt do anything by itself** ‚Äî it simply defines **how Terraform should connect** to a remote machine *if* it needs to.

It‚Äôs like a **set of instructions** saying:

> ‚ÄúIf you ever need to SSH into this instance, use this username, key, and host.‚Äù

But ‚Äî it only *comes into play* **when a provisioner needs to connect remotely**, e.g. `remote-exec` or `file`.

---

### üîë So:

| Case                                         | Does Terraform use the connection? | Why                                                |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Only `connection {}` block (no provisioners) | ‚ùå No                               | Terraform has no reason to connect                 |
| With `remote-exec` provisioner               | ‚úÖ Yes                              | Needs to SSH into the instance                     |
| With `file` provisioner                      | ‚úÖ Yes                              | Needs to copy files into the instance              |
| With only `local-exec`                       | ‚ùå No                               | That one runs locally on your computer, not in AWS |

### PROVISIONER REMOTE-EXEC vs USER_DATA

### ‚úÖ **Similarities**

| Feature                                               | `remote-exec` | `user_data` |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Runs commands on the EC2 instance                     | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes       |
| Can install packages, clone repos, configure software | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes       |
| Executes during instance creation                     | ‚úÖ Yes         | ‚úÖ Yes       |

So conceptually ‚Äî both are ways of ‚Äúbootstrapping‚Äù or ‚Äúinitializing‚Äù an EC2 instance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Differences**

| Aspect                          | `remote-exec`                                                                    | `user_data`                                                  |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Where it runs**               | From your **local Terraform client** (over SSH)                                  | Inside the **instance itself** (via EC2 cloud-init)          |
| **How it connects**             | Needs SSH connection defined in `connection {}`                                  | No SSH needed ‚Äî AWS handles it automatically                 |
| **When it runs**                | After Terraform successfully creates the instance and gets the IP                | During instance boot (as part of EC2 launch)                 |
| **Execution environment**       | Terraform must be able to reach the instance (e.g., via public IP, open port 22) | Works even if instance is private (since it runs internally) |
| **Idempotence (repeatability)** | Re-runs on every Terraform apply if resource changes                             | Runs **once** per instance at first boot                     |
| **Typical use cases**           | Post-deployment config, debugging, one-off fixes                                 | Initial provisioning, bootstrapping software                 |

### üß† Example Comparison

#### Using `remote-exec`:

```hcl
provisioner "remote-exec" {
  inline = [
    "sudo apt update -y",
    "sudo apt install -y nginx",
  ]
}
```

Terraform SSHes into the EC2 instance *after creation* and runs these commands.

---

#### Using `user_data`:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxx"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              apt update -y
              apt install -y nginx
              EOF
}
```

AWS runs the script *inside* the instance as it boots up ‚Äî no SSH needed.

---

### üöÄ Best Practice

* Prefer **`user_data`** for:

  * Initial setup (installing packages, setting configs)
  * Auto-scaling or immutable infrastructure
    *(e.g., when instances are frequently recreated)*

* Use **`remote-exec`** for:

  * Testing or manual setup demos
  * Situations where you **must SSH** to do a quick configuration
  * When user_data isn‚Äôt enough or you need fine control after creation
