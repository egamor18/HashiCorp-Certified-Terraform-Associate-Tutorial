### TERRAFORM CONNECTION
---

## 🌐 What Is a Terraform Connection?

In Terraform, a **connection** block defines **how Terraform connects to a remote resource** — typically a virtual machine — so it can run commands, copy files, or provision software.

It tells Terraform:

* **Which protocol** to use (SSH or WinRM)
* **What credentials** to use (user, password, private key)
* **Which host** to connect to (IP or hostname)

---

## 🧱 Basic Structure

Here’s a simple example:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ec2-user"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo yum update -y",
      "echo 'Hello from Terraform!' > /home/ec2-user/hello.txt"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🧩 Explanation

| Section                     | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `connection`                | Defines how to connect to the instance                       |
| `type`                      | Connection protocol — `"ssh"` (Linux) or `"winrm"` (Windows) |
| `user`                      | Username for the connection                                  |
| `private_key`               | Path to SSH private key file                                 |
| `host`                      | IP or DNS of the resource (often `self.public_ip`)           |
| `provisioner "remote-exec"` | Runs commands remotely using the above connection            |

## 🪄 What Terraform Does

When Terraform runs:

1. It creates the resource (e.g., EC2 instance)
2. Waits for it to become reachable
3. Uses the `connection` details to SSH (or WinRM) into it
4. Executes the commands in the `provisioner` block

---

## ⚙️ Example – File Upload

Terraform can also **copy files** to the remote host:

```hcl
provisioner "file" {
  source      = "local_script.sh"
  destination = "/tmp/remote_script.sh"
}
```

This uses the same `connection` block to know **how** to reach the machine.

## 🔒 Common Parameters

| Parameter     | Purpose                                  |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `type`        | "ssh" (Linux/macOS) or "winrm" (Windows) |
| `host`        | IP or hostname                           |
| `user`        | Remote username                          |
| `password`    | Password for WinRM or SSH (less common)  |
| `private_key` | File path or inline private key          |
| `agent`       | Use local SSH agent (true/false)         |
| `timeout`     | Connection timeout duration              |

---

## 💡 Important Notes

* The `connection` block **only works** with **provisioners** (like `file`, `remote-exec`, etc.).
* Provisioners are **imperative** (run commands) — Terraform recommends using them **sparingly**.
* If possible, use **cloud-init**, **user_data**, or **configuration management tools** (like Ansible) instead.
* Connections only happen **after** the resource is created.

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls

| Problem                         | Cause                                             | Fix                             |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `timeout while waiting for SSH` | Instance not ready or security group blocking SSH | Open port 22 and add delays     |
| `permission denied (publickey)` | Wrong private key or user                         | Verify correct key and username |
| `provisioner error`             | Bad command or wrong file path                    | Test commands manually first    |

✅ **In short:**

> A Terraform `connection` block is like a **temporary remote access session** Terraform uses to configure your new machine right after creating it.

## 🔐 Why We Need These TLS Keys in Terraform

When you create an **EC2 instance** in AWS, you usually need a way to **log in securely via SSH**.
AWS uses a **Key Pair** for this — a **public key** (stored in AWS) and a **private key** (kept by you).

---

### 🧩 The 3 Resources and Their Roles

#### 1️⃣ `tls_private_key`

```hcl
resource "tls_private_key" "generated" {
  algorithm = "RSA"
}
```

* This **creates a new cryptographic key pair** (private + public key).
* Terraform generates both in-memory when applying your configuration.
* The algorithm “RSA” tells Terraform to use RSA encryption, which is standard for SSH keys.

✅ **What it produces:**

* `private_key_pem` → The private key in PEM format
* `public_key_openssh` → The public key in the OpenSSH format (used by AWS)

---

#### 2️⃣ `local_file`

```hcl
resource "local_file" "private_key_pem" {
  content  = tls_private_key.generated.private_key_pem
  filename = "MyAWSKey.pem"
}
```

* This **saves your private key to a file on your local machine** (e.g. `MyAWSKey.pem`).
* You’ll use this file later to **SSH into your EC2 instance**:

  ```bash
  ssh -i MyAWSKey.pem ubuntu@<public_ip>
  ```
* Without saving it locally, you’d have no way to connect to the instance.

---

#### 3️⃣ `aws_key_pair`

```hcl
resource "aws_key_pair" "generated" {
  key_name   = "MyAWSKey"
  public_key = tls_private_key.generated.public_key_openssh
}
```

* This uploads the **public key** to AWS.
* AWS stores this in EC2 → Key Pairs.
* When you launch an EC2 instance, you tell it to use `key_name = "MyAWSKey"`.
* AWS then **injects the public key into the instance’s authorized_keys file**, allowing you to SSH using your private key.

✅ **So the EC2 instance trusts you** because:

* AWS knows the public key (from Terraform)
* You own the matching private key (saved as `MyAWSKey.pem`)

---

### 🧠 Summary: What Each Resource Does

| Terraform Resource | Purpose                                   | Output / Effect             |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `tls_private_key`  | Generates new key pair (public + private) | In-memory key material      |
| `local_file`       | Saves private key to a local `.pem` file  | Local SSH key               |
| `aws_key_pair`     | Uploads public key to AWS                 | Registered in EC2 key pairs |

---

### ⚠️ Security Tip

* The `.pem` file is **sensitive**.
  Always protect it using:

  ```bash
  chmod 600 MyAWSKey.pem
  ```
* Never upload it to GitHub or share it.

---

## 🔐 Why `chmod 600 MyAWSKey.pem`

When you run:

```bash
chmod 600 MyAWSKey.pem
```

You’re setting **file permissions** in Linux to tightly restrict access to your private key file.

---

### 🧩 What `600` Means (Permission Breakdown)

Each digit represents permissions for a category of users:

| Digit       | Who        | Permission               |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| **1st (6)** | **Owner**  | Read (4) + Write (2) = 6 |
| **2nd (0)** | **Group**  | No permission            |
| **3rd (0)** | **Others** | No permission            |

So `600` means:

> ✅ The file’s **owner** can read and write it.
> 🚫 No one else (no group members, no other users) can access it.

---

### 🧠 Why It’s Required for SSH Keys

When you use SSH to connect like this:

```bash
ssh -i MyAWSKey.pem ubuntu@<ip-address>
```

SSH **checks the file permissions** of your key before using it.

If the private key file is accessible by anyone else (like group or others), SSH refuses to use it, and you’ll see this error:

```
WARNING: UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!
Permissions 0644 for 'MyAWSKey.pem' are too open.
```

SSH enforces this rule because **a private key must remain private** — otherwise, anyone with access could impersonate you.

---

### ✅ Correct Permission Levels

| Command     | Meaning                  | Safe for SSH? |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| `chmod 600` | Read/write by owner only | ✅ Yes         |
| `chmod 400` | Read-only by owner       | ✅ Yes         |
| `chmod 644` | Readable by everyone     | ❌ No          |

In most tutorials (including AWS), they use `chmod 400`, but `600` also works and allows you to edit the file if needed.
