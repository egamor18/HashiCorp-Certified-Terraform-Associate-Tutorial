### 🌿 More About — Terraform Module Variables & Outputs

* **Required Variables:**
  Any variable in a module without a default value must be explicitly provided when the module is used.

* **Outputs:**
  Modules expose only specific values to the outside world through their `outputs.tf` file.
  You can reference these using the syntax:

  ```
  module.<module_name>.<output_name>
  ```

  Example:

  ```hcl
  module.server.public_ip
  ```

  Without outputs, other parts of Terraform cannot reference or depend on that module’s resources.

* **Why Outputs Matter:**
  They define what data from a child module can be accessed by the root module or other modules, ensuring proper dependency management.

### 🧭 Best Practices When Building Modules

1. **Encapsulation:**
   Group resources that are always deployed together; avoid mixing unrelated infrastructure.

2. **Privileges:**
   Keep modules within specific privilege or responsibility boundaries to maintain security.

3. **Volatility:**
   Separate stable (long-lived) infrastructure like databases from frequently redeployed resources like app servers.

---

### ⚙️ Design Guidelines

* Build for **80% of common use cases** — don’t overcomplicate for edge cases.
* Keep each module **focused and narrow in scope.**
* Expose only the **most commonly modified variables** as inputs.

## 🌍 Terraform Public Module Registry — Summary

### 🧩 What It Is

The **Terraform Public Module Registry** (maintained by HashiCorp) is a central repository where users can **find, share, and reuse** Terraform modules created by the community.
It supports:

* **Versioning** (to manage module updates)
* **Search and filtering** (to easily find modules)
* **Quick deployment** of common infrastructure setups

Modules from the registry use this format:

```
<NAMESPACE>/<NAME>/<PROVIDER>
```

Example:

```
terraform-aws-modules/s3-bucket/aws
```

---

🧠 **Benefit:**
Modules like these simplify complex infrastructure — for example, creating an entire VPC (subnets, NAT gateways, route tables, etc.) in a few lines.

### 🚀 Task 3 — Publishing Your Own Module

You can publish your module to the **Terraform Public Registry**, provided you meet the following:

#### ✅ Requirements:

1. Hosted on **GitHub** (public repository).
2. Must follow **naming convention**:

   ```
   terraform-<PROVIDER>-<NAME>
   ```

   e.g. `terraform-aws-ec2-instance`
3. Include a **clear description** in the repo.
4. Follow standard Terraform structure:

   ```
   main.tf
   variables.tf
   outputs.tf
   ```
5. Use **semantic version tags** (e.g., `v1.0.0`, `0.9.2`) for releases.

---

### 💡 Key Takeaways

* Terraform modules encourage **code reuse and consistency**.
* The **Public Module Registry** is the easiest way to leverage community-built infrastructure.
* Modules must be **well-structured, versioned, and documented** for publication.

Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to **publish your Terraform module to the Public Registry** after meeting all the requirements:

## **Steps to Publish a Module to the Terraform Public Registry After Meeting the Above Requirements**


### **3. Log in to the Terraform Registry**

1. Go to the [Terraform Public Module Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/).
2. Click **“Sign in with GitHub”**.
3. Allow Terraform to access your GitHub repos.

---

### **4. Add Your Module to the Registry**

1. After logging in, click **“Publish Module”**.
2. Select your **GitHub repository**.
3. Fill in module details:

   * **Name** (auto-detected from repo)
   * **Provider** (e.g., AWS, Google)
   * **Short description**
   * **Module categories** (optional)
4. Submit the module.

> The registry will inspect your module, read the `variables.tf` and `outputs.tf`, generate documentation, and display it on the registry page.

---

### **5. Version Management**

* Each release tag corresponds to a module version.
* Users can reference specific versions:

```hcl
module "my-module" {
  source  = "username/module-name/aws"
  version = "1.0.0"
}
```

* Update the module by adding a **new GitHub release** and the registry will pick up the new version.

---

### ✅ **Tips**

* Include **good README documentation** with example usage — it helps others use your module.
* Only expose **commonly changed variables** in `variables.tf`.
* Include **outputs** for any value you want other modules or configurations to consume.

## Final Notes

Terraform follows the **DRY principle** (*Don’t Repeat Yourself*), so you should avoid creating modules that already exist. In other words, **don’t reinvent the wheel**.

Before creating your own modules, it is **highly recommended** to search for publicly available modules that may already meet your needs.
