# HashiCorp Terraform Associate Hands-On Tutorial

This repository provides **practical, hands-on examples** covering the key topics required for the **HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate exam**.

Itâ€™s designed to help you **bridge the gap between theory and practice**. I created this tutorial while preparing for the exam, which I successfully passed, and I hope it serves as a useful resource for anyone learning Terraform.
